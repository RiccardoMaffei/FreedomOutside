You should run away and immediately find a weapon.  \r\n>Let the game begin!\r\n\r\n### The UI\r\nIn every turn a basic interface is shown to the player.  \r\nThe interface is composed by:    \r\n* A map\r\n* The current prisoner's name\r\n* The prisoner's info\r\n* The prisoners in the room\r\n* A list of actions\r\n* The action result\r\n\r\n##### The map\r\nThe map section shows the explored part of the map from the perspective of the current prisoner.\r\nEvery prisoner can view only up to 2 rooms away from his position in every direction but can't see if and where are other prisoners because the lighting system is not working properly in the old prison and the other prisoners are hidden.  \r\nEvery prisoner can see other prisoners if they are in the same room.\r\n\r\n##### The current prisoner's name\r\nThe current prisoner number and his/her name is shown to recognize the player who should play the current turn.\r\n\r\n##### The prisoner's info\r\nIn this section there are the basic prisoner's info such as:\r\n* The health\r\n* The agility\r\n* The strength\r\n* The inventory list\r\n* The armor\r\n\r\n##### The prisoners in the room\r\nWhile prisoners in other rooms are hidden, you can still see prisoners in your same room. You can see their number, name and health.\r\n\r\n##### The list of action\r\nThe list of action is the central part of the game. Everything you can do is shown in this section. You are asked to write your choice (the number of action) and press enter to execute it.\r\n\r\n##### The action result\r\nThe action result is shown for a bit and then starts the turn of the following player.\r\n\r\n### The game flow\r\nFreedom Outside is a turn-based game.  \r\nThe game flow is very simple:\r\n\r\n1. The title and the prologue is shown.\r\n2. Every player is asked for its name.\r\n3. While there is more than one player alive\r\n  1. The interface is shown.\r\n  2. The player is asked to choose his/her action choice.\r\n  3. The action is executed.\r\n  4. The action result is shown.\r\n4. The winner (if there is one) is shown.\r\n\r\n### Prisoner's statistics and damage logic\r\nEvery player has:\r\n\r\nProperty name | Default value | Min value | Max value | How to increase | How to decrease\r\n------------- | ------------- | --------- | --------- | --------------- | ---------------\r\nHealth | 100 | 0 | 100 | heal yourself | s.b. damage you\r\nAgility | 1.00 | 1.00 | 4.00 | move around | not implemented yet\r\nStrength | 1.00 | 1.00 | 4.00 | combat | not implemented yet\r\nArmor protection | no armor (1.00) | 1.00 | 4.00 | change armor | change armor\r\n\r\nDamages are divided in given and received:\r\n##### Given damages\r\nGiven damages are computed with the following formula:  \r\n````\r\ngiven_damages = strength * weapon_damage_value\r\n````\r\nIn case of destructive weapon the damage value is random (between a range) and when the attacker and the attacked player are the same, the given damages are divided by the attacker agility simulating his/her agility to run away (E.g.: when throwing a grenade).\r\n\r\n##### Received damages\r\nReceived damages are computed with the following formula:  \r\n````\r\nreceived_damages = inbound_damage / (agility * armor_protection)\r\n````\r\n### Actions\r\nActions can be summarized as follows:\r\n* Hide yourself (wait).\r\n* Move to north/south/east/west.\r\n* Pickup/drop any item (according to the inventory size).\r\n* Wear/unwear an armor.\r\n* Combat against other prisoners using weapons.\r\n* Heal yourself using potions.\r\n\r\n### Items\r\nItems are everything that can be picked up or dropped. They spawn around the map according to some probability rules.  \r\nItems are divided as follows:\r\n\r\n* Weapons\r\n * Simple weapons\r\n * Destructive weapons\r\n* Health kits\r\n* Armors\r\n\r\n##### Weapons\r\nWeapons are special items which can be used to combat against other players.  \r\nSimple weapons are weapons with a standard damage value and are used against one prisoner only while destructive weapons are used against every prisoner in the room and they have a random damage value in a range.\r\n\r\nThe simple weapons are:  \r\n\r\nWeapon name | Damage value | Probability %\r\n----------- | ------------ | -------------\r\nRotten wooden plank | 1 | 21\r\nWooden plank | 2 | 20\r\nSharp wooden plank | 3 | 19\r\nRotten stick | 4 | 18\r\nStick | 5 | 17\r\nRusty iron pipe | 6 | 16\r\nIron pipe | 7 | 15\r\nHammer | 8 | 14\r\nKnife | 9 | 13\r\nSword | 10 | 12\r\nSpear | 15 | 11\r\nAxe | 20 | 10\r\nIron mace | 30 | 9\r\nBlowgun | 29 | 8\r\nBow | 25 | 7\r\nSlingshot | 30 | 6\r\nHunting Bow | 35 | 5\r\nHandgun | 45 | 4\r\nRifle | 60 | 3\r\nShotgun | 70 | 2\r\nAk-47 | 90 | 1\r\n\r\nThe destructive weapons are:  \r\n\r\nWeapon name | Min damage value | Min damage value | Probability %\r\n----------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------\r\nMolotov | 30 | 80 | 6\r\nGrenade | 35 | 85 | 5\r\nTNT | 50 | 100 | 2\r\n\r\n##### Health kits\r\nHealth kits are special items which can be used to heal yourself.\r\n\r\nThey are:  \r\n\r\nKit name | Heal value | Probability %\r\n-------- | ---------- | -------------\r\nTiny healing potion | 5 | 25\r\nSmall healing potion | 10 | 15\r\nMedium healing potion | 30 | 5\r\nBig healing potion | 50 | 2\r\nHuge healing potion | 100 | 1\r\n\r\n##### Armors\r\nArmors are special items which can be worn and used to protect yourself against damages.\r\n\r\nThey are:  \r\n\r\nArmor name | Protection factor | Probability %\r\n---------- | ----------------- | -------------\r\nRags armor | 1.1 | 20\r\nLeather armor | 1.2 | 18\r\nHide armor | 1.3 | 15\r\nCopper armor | 1.4 | 9\r\nBronze armor | 1.5 | 7\r\nIron armor | 1.6 | 5\r\nSteel armor | 1.7 | 3\r\nGold armor | 1.8 | 2\r\nDiamond armor | 1.9 | 1\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nThis software is released under the GNU GPL v3.0 license.  \r\nA copy of the license is provided in the LICENSE file.\r\n\r\n>Copyright (C) 2016  Riccardo Maffei, Federico Bertani, Danilo Branca.\r\n\r\n>This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n>it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n>the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n>(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n>but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n>MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
